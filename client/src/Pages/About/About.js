						<h2>Kansas Partnership for Applied Computational Thinking</h2>
						KS-PACT is a regional chapter of the Computer Science Teachers Association with a special mission &emdash;
						incorporating computation into K-12 curriculum not as its own discipline for its own sake, but rather, as a
						tool supporting other disciplines, i.e. music, literature, mathematics, science, and social studies.
						<br />
						KS-PACT was formed as a partnership between Kansas State Computer Science and Education faculty and K-12
						teachers who had been involved in programs sponsored by these departments like GK-12 INSIGHT and CI-TEAM.
						Additionally, Kansas State University’s ACM-W student club – organized with the goal of increasing diversity
						in computing careers - has joined the team and will be helping answer teachers’ questions about CT and visiting
						K-12 classrooms to help with computing activities and work with students.
						<br />
						KS-PACT will supply curriculum materials and software tools custom-designed for the needs of K-12 teachers to
						its members. These materials will be available on the KS-PACT website, sorted by grade band and searchable by
						subject and specific standards. The KS-PACT website also features a forum where teachers can pose questions
						they have about computing, and receive speedy responses from KSU Faculty and ACM-W students. We also are offering
						sensor and computing equipment collected through past grant programs in a lending library that teachers can reserve
						for a week or two of use in their own classroom.
						<br />
						<h2>Interested?</h2>
						If you would like to become a charter member of KS-PACT, sign up on the login page. There is no cost for becoming
						a member, and a world of potential benefits.

						Keep watching this website for updates!
